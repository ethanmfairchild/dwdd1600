            <h2>Terms to know before you get into it:</h2>
            <dl>
                <dt><strong>Stoke</strong></dt>
                <dd>A term used to describe the pure excitement and joy that comes from surfing. If someone is "stoked,"
                    they're feeling amped up, happy, and energized-whether it's from catching an epic wave or just being
                    out in the water.</dd>

                <dt><strong>Getting Barrelled</strong></dt>
                <dd>This refers to riding inside the hollow part of a wave, also known as the tube. It's one of the most
                    sought-after experiences in surfing, where the wave curls over the surfer, creating a tunnel-like
                    effect.</dd>

                <dt><strong>It's Pumping</strong></dt>
                <dd>A phrase used when the waves are really good-big, clean, and consistent. When someone says, "It's
                    pumping," it means the surf conditions are on fire, and it's time to grab your board and hit the
                    water.</dd>
            </dl>

            <h2>Recent Articles/Videos</h2>

            <p><strong>UNLOCKED: Chippa Wilson Stars In 'Zipper' - A Surf Film By Stab & Monster</strong></p>
            <p>The title Zipper was first proposed by one of our video editors, Will Stiles - a man who doesn't speak
                often, but when he does, you listen. Will thought the whole team knew why he picked it - we didn't.
                Eventually he told us. "It's about stitching different styles and personalities together in a surf world
                that is often clique-ish and compartmentalized."</p>

            <p><strong>Watch: John John Florence's All-Day Haleiwa Surf Bender</strong></p>
            <p>Haleiwa requires all your chips on the table. There's no half-heartedness at the wave situated near the
                mouth of the North Shore harbor. A surfer is either clawing/scraping/fighting the current just for the
                chance to maintain their position, or they are too far gone. </p>
